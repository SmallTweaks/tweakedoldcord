# TweakedOldcord
So this is a themes/CSS code that I cobbled together from specific pieces of OldCord (one of which I tweaked so that the emojis in the picker pop up wouldn't be wierdly small), individual pieces of the code posted by Pixielart (available here https://github.com/Pixielart/CustomiseOldcord) that I then tweaked to get the colors and emoji sizes I wanted.

Note that the coloring for reactions, linked messages/pings, and so forth have been tailored for light mode (I did my best to recreate how the pre-refresh 2025 version looked).

Below is the result!
<img width="1434" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-18 at 10 39 51â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a56dfc1c-d89c-411d-b0a0-00981740a8ba" />

There is also the issue that the highlighted background for direct replies/pings washes out the background box of a person's tag. No idea how to fix that, but maybe it won't bother you. The workaround I'm curently using is having the RoleColorEverywhere plugin toggled (Vencord).

If you're interested in using, add
```
@import url("https://smalltweaks.github.io/tweakedoldcord/");
```
into your quick CSS editor.

The individual code pieces (it's messy looking, sorry, not sure how to fix that) can be found at the URL if you just want to tweak or use pieces of it.
